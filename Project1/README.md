# Project 1: Doing data Modeling using different machine Learning:
**MLR: Multiple Linear Regression**
**SVM: Support Vector Machine**
**ANN: Artificial neural network**

# Complete this project:
-	writing the codes that have not been implemented:
  . rescale_date (….)
  . removeInvalidData (…..)

-	and run the program with three different machine learning tools.
  . MLR (Multiple Linear Regression)
  . SVM (support Vector Machine)
  . ANN (Artificial Neural Network)

-	And 
  . Make the entire program to be object oriented
