# Project 1: Doing data Modeling using different machine Learning:
**MLR: Multiple Linear Regression**
**SVM: Support Vector Machine**
**ANN: Artificial neural network**

# Complete this project:
-	writing the codes that have not been implemented 
rescale_date (….)
removeInvalidData (…..)
-	and run the program with three different machine learning tools.
MLR (Multiple Linear Regression)
SVM (support Vector Machine)
ANN (Artificial Neural Network)
-	And 
Make the entire program to be object oriented
