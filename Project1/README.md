# Project 1: Doing data Modeling using different Machine Learning
  **MLR: Multiple Linear Regression**
  
  **SVM: Support Vector Machine**
  
  **ANN: Artificial neural network**

## Complete this project:
*Write the codes that have not been implemented:*
  - rescale_date (….)
  - removeInvalidData (…..)

*Run the program with three different machine learning tools:*
  - MLR (Multiple Linear Regression)
  - SVM (support Vector Machine)
  - ANN (Artificial Neural Network)

*And*
  - Make the entire program to be object oriented
