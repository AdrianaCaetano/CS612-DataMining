# Project 1: Doing data Modeling using different machine Learning:
**MLR: Multiple Linear Regression**
**SVM: Support Vector Machine**
**ANN: Artificial neural network**

# Complete this project:
-	writing the codes that have not been implemented 
o	rescale_date (….)
o	removeInvalidData (…..)
-	and run the program with three different machine learning tools.
o	MLR (Multiple Linear Regression)
o	SVM (support Vector Machine)
o	ANN (Artificial Neural Network)
-	And 
o	Make the entire program to be object oriented
